@phdthesis{These,
	abstract = {This thesis deals mainly with limit theorems for empirical processes of extreme cluster functionals of weakly dependent random fields and sequences. Limit theorems for empirical processes of extreme cluster functionals of stationnary time series are given by Drees & Rootz{\'e}n [2010] under absolute regularity (or "$\beta$-mixing") conditions. However, these dependence conditions of mixing type are very restrictive: on the one hand, they are best suited for models in finance and history, and on the other hand, they are difficult to verify. Generally, for other models common in applications, the mixing conditions are not satisfied. In contrast, weak dependence conditions, as defined by Doukhan & Louhichi [1999] and Dedecker & Prieur [2004a], are dependence conditions which generalises the notions of mixing and association. These are easier to verify and applicable to a wide list of models. More precisely, under weak conditions, all the causal or non-causal processes are weakly dependent: Gaussian, associated, linear, ARCH($\infty$), bilinear and Volterra processes are some included in this list. Under these conveniences, we expand some of the limit theorems of Drees & Rootz{\'e}n [2010] to weakly dependent processes. These latter results are used in order to show the convergence in distribution of the extremogram estimator of Davis & Mikosch [2009] and the functional estimator of the extremal index introduced by Drees [2011] under weak dependence. We prove an extreme value theorem for weakly dependent stationary random fields and we propose, under the same conditions, a domain of attraction criteria of a law of extremes. The document ends with limit theorems for the empirical process of extreme cluster functionals of stationary weakly dependent random fields, deriving also the convergence in distribution of the estimator of an extremogram for stationary weakly dependent space-time processes.},
