I am currently a Lecturer and Researcher at <a href='https://ensai.fr'>ENSAI</a> and the <a href='https://crest.science'>CREST</a> lab. 
My teaching responsibilities in the Statistics Department primarily focus on statistical learning, time series and extreme value theory.

Before joining ENSAI, I held a similar position at <a href='https://mia-ps.inrae.fr'>AgroParisTech/INRAE/Université Paris-Saclay</a>, where I primarily taught and researched statistical modeling of environmental and biological data.

I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship in machine learning at <a href='https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr'>LMNO/ UNICAEN</a>, working on mixture models and models based on deep neural networks. During this period, I co-organized the <a href='https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr/seminaires/statprobasdonnees'>Statistics and Data Science Working Group</a> and participated in various teaching activities at UNICAEN and ENSAI.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Statistics-Mathematics from <a href='https://www.cyu.fr'>CY Cergy Paris Université</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://doukhan.perso.cyu.fr'>Paul Doukhan</a>, and a research master's in stochastic geometry from the <a href='http://www.ucv.ve'>Central University of Venezuela</a>, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9pjGAFoAAAAJ&hl=fr'>José R. (Chichi) León</a>.
