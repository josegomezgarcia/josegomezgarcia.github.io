I am currently an assistant professor (maître de conférences) in Statistics and Statistical Learning at the <a href='https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr'>MAP5</a> lab and the Data Sciences (DS) department of the <a href='https://iutparis-seine.u-paris.fr'>IUT de Paris - Rives de Seine</a>,  <a href='https://u-paris.fr'>Université Paris Cité</a>.

My teaching responsibilities in the DS department primarily include courses on time series analysis, survival analysis, and regression. Before joining the MAP5 lab and the IUT de Paris, I was a Lecturer and Researcher at <a href='https://ensai.fr'>ENSAI</a> and the <a href='https://crest.science'>CREST</a> lab (2023-2024) and at <a href='https://mia-ps.inrae.fr'>AgroParisTech/INRAE/Université Paris-Saclay</a> (2020-2023), where I concentrated on teaching and researching in statistical modeling of environmental and biological data, and collaborated with <a href='https://mia-ps.inrae.fr/liliane-bel'>Liliane Bel</a> on a research project that deals with trend detection of extreme values of spatio-temporal processes with applications to climate data. The courses at these two schools included unsupervised classification methods (K-means and HCA), dimension reduction methods through PCA, supervised classification methods (KNN, Bayes, LDA, QDA, CART, Random Forest), as well as forecasting methods in time series and the analysis of extreme values.

I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship in machine learning at <a href='https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr'>LMNO/UNICAEN</a> (2017-2019), working on mixture models and deep neural network-based models in collaboration with <a href='https://fadili.users.greyc.fr'>Jalal Fadili</a> and <a href='https://chesneau.users.lmno.cnrs.fr'> Christophe Chesneau</a>. During this period, I attended several trainings by <a href='https://www.criann.fr'>CRIANN</a>, co-organized the <a href='https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr/seminaires/statprobasdonnees'>Statistics and Data Science Working Group</a> of the LMNO, and taught as a part-time lecturer in the MIASHS program at <a href='https://www.unicaen.fr'>UNICAEN</a> as well as at ENSAI.

I was also a temporary teaching and research associate (ATER) at the <a href='https://galilee.univ-paris13.fr'>Galilée Institute/Université Sorbonne Paris Nord</a> (2016-2017), as well as at the public school of health and digital engineering <a href='https://episen.u-pec.fr'>EPISEN/Université Paris-Est Créteil</a> (2019-2020). 

Before my arrival in France, I was a Mathematics Instructor Professor (a civil service position obtained through a competitive exam) at the Faculty of Sciences of the <a href='http://www.ucv.ve'>Central University of Venezuela</a> (2009-2012) and a part-time lecturer in the School of Economics at the same university.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Statistics-Mathematics from <a href='https://www.cyu.fr'>CY Cergy Paris Université</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://doukhan.perso.cyu.fr'>Paul Doukhan</a>, and a research master's in stochastic geometry from the Central University of Venezuela, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9pjGAFoAAAAJ&hl=fr'>José R. (Chichi) León</a>.
