I am currently a Lecturer and Researcher at the <a href='https://ensai.fr'>ENSAI</a> and <a href='https://crest.science'>CREST</a>, both members of <a href='https://www.groupe-genes.fr'>GENES</a>. My teaching responsibilities in the statistics department primarily focus on statistical learning, time series, and extreme value theory. These courses include unsupervised classification methods (K-means and HCA), dimension reduction method through PCA, supervised classification methods (KNN, Bayes, LDA, QDA, CART, Random Forest), as well as forecasting methods in time series and the analysis of their extreme values.

Before joining ENSAI, I held a similar position at <a href='https://mia-ps.inrae.fr'>Université Paris-Saclay/AgroParisTech/INRAE</a>, where I primarily taught statistical modeling of environmental and biological data.

I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship in machine learning at the Nicolas Oresme Mathematics Laboratory of UNICAEN, working on mixture models and models based on deep neural networks. During this period, I co-organized the <a href='https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr/seminaires/statprobasdonnees'>Statistics and Data Science Working Group</a> and participated in various teaching activities at UNICAEN and ENSAI.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Statistics-Mathematics from <a href='https://www.cyu.fr'>CY Cergy Paris Université</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://doukhan.perso.cyu.fr'>Paul Doukhan</a>, and a research master's in stochastic geometry from the Universidad Central de Venezuela, supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9pjGAFoAAAAJ&hl=fr'>José R. (Chichi) León</a>.
